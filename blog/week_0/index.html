<h2 id="last-time">Last Time</h2>
<p>I'm struggling not to make this blog post echo the tone of a college essay. It seems almost ironic that, after four years of attending university, the tropes I would return to are those I clumsily used to be accepted in the first place. It has become so familiar to present my first batch at the Recurse Center, and the events that preceded it, as an almost idealized catalyzing moment in my development. I'm going to try to avoid that trope here, but I can only do so well.</p>
<p>In 2014 I attended the Recurse Center months after my then-girlfriend of nine months took her own life. Not yet old enough, at the age of sixteen, to understand and cope with these feelings, I found peace in my work. At that time, I had been four years into a journey of self-teaching myself programming. Working on that project, my ravenous consumption of knowledge, gave me a kind of peace I could not find elsewhere. However unbeknownst to me, somewhere in my unconscious, perspective was growing; things that once seemed all consuming were not, and things that once seemed insurmountable seemed, for lack of better phrasing, seemed totally doable.</p>
<p>I was in desperate need of an environment to explore my independence. The Recurse Center provided that environment. I attended Fall 2, 2014, and found myself surrounded by wonderful people who, whether they knew it or not, helped catapault me to where I am today. I won't belabor the trope of personal growth (when I cannot show, only tell, it's probably best to skip it entirely), but I'm eternally thankful for everyone in Fall 1, Fall 2, and Winter 1, 2014 for helping shape me in that formative time.</p>
<h2 id="this-time">This Time</h2>
<p>This time around, I feel like I'm a completely different person. I would hope no less for myself, considering that the six years between 16 and 22 are supposed to be formative. Where I was, in no uncertain terms, a young boy before, I am now so much more prepared for what will come. I'm going to be living with my girlfriend of several years in the city. I'm going to be old enough to join in on, erm, after-school activities. I'm going to be able to interact with members of the community as, if not equal, then at least a hell of a lot more equal than last time.</p>
<p>Even more, I'm excited to use the knowledge that I gained last time around to help other members of the Recurse community. In 2014 I was a sponge, pulling in all of the knowledge I could muster. This time around, I hope to squeeze myself a little and let some of that knowledge back out. There will surely be programmers and computer scientists and developers far more accomplished than I am, but life has a curious way of giving every person their speciality. I'm just excited to share mine.</p>
<h2 id="this-blog">This Blog</h2>
<p>I kept a blog my last time at the Recurse Center, but I found that I only ever talked about my work. I want to make sure that I document more of my qualitative, personal experience this time around. I'm hoping that publicly documenting my intent will help me keep it. I mean to write, at minimum, at weekly post on each Friday. This one is coming out a little bit late because I've been in the middle of packing and preparing to move to NYC, but the rest will (should?) be on time.</p>
<p>P.S. Sorry if this is&hellip;rambling. I wrote it late at night. Maybe I'll do better next time :)</p>

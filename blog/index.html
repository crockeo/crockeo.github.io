<p>So I'm writing this from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>. Historically I had been a <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> user, with pretty-small-in-the-grand-scheme, but to my eyes pretty substantive vim config over at my <a href="https://github.com/crockeo/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repo. After deciding that I wanted something easier to use and configure, I hopped over to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vscode</a> train, which I really really liked. There was a part of me, however, that wished I could do just a little bit more configuration. The paradigm in vscode is that you either configure plugins you already have, with pure JSON, or you write a plugin of your own.</p>
<p>Since RC is about trying new things, I thought I'd do something radically different. Instead of trying to write my own vim or vscode plugins, why not try emacs? So I did! Right now I'm still getting the hang of configuration (I pretty much only have package installs and hotkeys set up), but I'm planning on learning more about how to do custom configurations by writing an emacs plugin or two sometime in the future. If you want to check out my conf, go to my <a href="https://github.com/crockeo/.emacs.d">.emacs.d</a> repo.</p>

<p>I'm still working on my math journey, but I've pivoted hard into learning Lean. I think it's going to give me a good way to understand the material I'm interested in from both the Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications and the Homotopy Type Theory textbooks. It's hard to motivate the same kind of rigorous proof when I'm doing exercises for myself, and I think Lean is going to help me reinstitute that rigor.</p>
<p>Progress update is:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Chapter 13 of AATA</li>
<li>On Proposition World of the Natural Number Game</li>
<li>On Chapter 4 of Theorem Proving in Lean</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-more">And More</h2>
<p>I just signed a lease this past week! Or maybe technically the week before, but either way a very new thing. I'm going to be up in Washington Heights, right by Columbia Medical. That is all.</p>

<h2 id="on-trust">On Trust</h2>
<p>It is not surprising that in a time of such uncertainty, we grasp at that which is familiar. Our collective fondness of nostalgic media betrays this desire. We keep reimagining our favorite movies, series, or games as a way to hold onto some kind of stable ground. Recently, I was walking out of the 155th street subway stop and saw, staring at me, a blunt reminder of this fact: Picard airing January 23rd on CBS All Access. I'm one of the first to admit that my personality was shaped by the ethics espoused by Star Trek: The Next Generation. During formative years of my life, the show acted as a moral compass, with Patrick Stewart's Picard as a shining north star.</p>
<p>Since starting RC, people have asked me a lot about <em>why</em> exactly I've decided to dedicate myself so totally to mathematics. Each time, I haven't really been able to come up with a satisfactory answer. I eventually settle for &ldquo;it's cool&rdquo; and move on. I wonder if, instead, it's another strategy for dealing with uncertainty, not unlike nostalgia. Just as nostalgic media appeals to our pathos, mathematics grounds us in a way that appeals to our logos.</p>
<p>In a world moving further away from verifiable truths, there is some comfort in knowing that there exists an internally consistent system with which you can show the correctness of your beliefs—even if only within the system itself. This narrative only becomes stronger when you account for the fact that I'm spending most of my time learning about ground-floor level concepts in math like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">group theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory">Homotopy Type Theory</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">ZF Set Theory</a>. The former provides the practical basis of so much other math, including much of numerical analysis, while the latter two provide the theoretical basis for&hellip; everything. You don't ever need to work from a base level of trust, because you can verify the correctness of a system by showing its consistency.</p>
<p>But that narrative is wrong.</p>
<p>First, you cannot connect mathematics with the external world without trust that they are analogous. Although math is, fundamentally, the construction of models that reflect the real world, there is no way to formally show that connection. If one were to adopt a mathematical system to do so, they would fall into the same trap (maths all the way down).</p>
<p>Second, even if one weren't interested in showing the extrinsic correctness of math, there is no way to ensure our mathematical system is consistent. We can show that it isn't, as happened frequently in the <em>Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik</em>, like the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">Russel's Paradox</a> which showed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory">Naive Set Theory</a> that it was, indeed, naive. However for any consistent mathematical system, we will not be able to prove its consistency by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem</a>. The best we can do is to hope that we don't stumble across an inconsistency, and trust that our system is consistent.</p>
<h2 id="lean">Lean</h2>
<p>To get away from the &ldquo;deeply&rdquo; philosophical conversations likened to a teenager discovering relativism for the first time: I've been learning <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean</a>! It's a theorem prover, aka a competitor to <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>, with way better tooling. I'm picking it up as a means to validate the correctness of my proofs while working through <a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/">Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications</a> and <a href="https://hott.github.io/book/nightly/hott-online-1239-g9a4dadb.pdf">Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>Particularly with Homotopy Type Theory, I found myself so out of place with the introduction to Type Theory that I was unable to validate its internal consistency. At the suggestion of another Recurser, I jumped ahead to the exercises, but found them no help. If I couldn't show that my proofs were consistent (and in fact entailed that which I wanted to prove), then they were no more of an indication of consistency than the text itself.</p>
<p>And so: I turned to Lean! I've heard from some folks that it might not have the feature set required to go through the entirety of Homotopy Type Theory, but it should be able to handle the introductory chapters. As far as I'm concerned that's good enough for me. To learn Lean I'm going through the <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">Natural Number Game</a>, which has you define and prove lemmas and theorems about natural numbers using Peano's axioms. All in all it's a great time. If you're interested in math then I would definitely say that you should take a crack at it!</p>

<p>Week 1 of the Recurse Center! It's shocking to look back at my last time here, and think of all the things are the same. There's still some essential energy of the place that I remember here. The Recurse Center is now named the Recurse Center (instead of the prior &ldquo;Hacker School&rdquo;), it's hosted in a new building, it's 6 years in the future. Somehow, though, the energy is still the same. New faces are pursuing the same goals of self-improvement, with a single-minded focus that only an environment like the Recurse Center could provide.</p>
<p>I'm going to use the rest of this blog post to enumerate the things that I've worked on this week. Most of it is going to be abstract mathematics, so if you're not interested: scroll down to the Zulip Bot! That's going to be programming :)</p>
<h2 id="abstract-algebra-theory-and-application">Abstract Algebra: Theory and Application</h2>
<p>I've been working through <a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/">Abstract Algebra: Theory and Application</a>, an online open-source Abstract Algebra textbook. I've completed the first 5 chapters, up to Permutation Groups. I find myself torn on continuing at the pace I have been, because it feels like its usefulness is dwindling. Going in, I had been more interested in understanding the taxonomy of group- and ring-like structures that are formed by sets and their operations. After spending time in this book, I find that we're focusing strongly on groups. There are more interesting topics in the future (<a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/isomorph.html">isomorphisms</a>, <a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/rings.html">rings</a>, <a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/boolean.html">lattices</a>, etc.) but I don't know how much prior reading I need to do on groups to fundamentally understand them.</p>
<p>I can only imagine that the textbook is structured such that sections make reference to antecedent sections, if only to root new ideas, so I can't just skip ahead. I think I'll just have to slog through earlier work to find the things that interest me. Hopefully I'll learn interesting things along the way :)</p>
<h2 id="schapiras-notes-on-topology">Schapira's Notes on Topology</h2>
<p>Nothing breeds impostor syndrome more than a text that is, by all accounts, too advanced for your current knowledge. I started reading Pierre Schapira's notes on <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~pierre.schapira/lectnotes/AlTo.pdf">Algebra and Topology</a>, and found myself quickly lost. He was using algebraic strucutres I have no experience with to root conversations around &ldquo;modules and linear maps,&rdquo; neither of which I now understand.</p>
<p>I think this is a valuable experience in and of itself. Learning is hard, and finding resources that match where you are in your learning process are crucial to achieving the learning you want. Another Recurser told me the name of a textbook, <a href="https://hott.github.io/book/nightly/hott-online-1239-g9a4dadb.pdf">Homotopy and Type Theory</a>, that was more on my level. I'm several sections in (at 1.4!) and I'm having a way better time.</p>
<h2 id="homotopy-and-type-theory">Homotopy and Type Theory</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned above, I'm working through <a href="https://hott.github.io/book/nightly/hott-online-1239-g9a4dadb.pdf">Homotopy and Type Theory</a>. I find the proposal of Type Theory in this book as an interesting alternative to ZF(C) Set Theory. They propose that Type Theory provides an approach to defining mathematical structure with only one element, a type rather than the two required by ZF Set Theory. As someone, unknowingly, steeped in ZF Set Theory, it's hard for me to precisely understand the difference, but in short, Type Theory provides a similar basis of mathmatics under a univalient system, instead of a bivalent system.</p>
<p>ZF Set Theory provides two basic building blocks, first are the sets themselves. Second are the operations one performs on those sets. Additionally, ZF Set Theory relies extensively on the existing structure of first order predicate logic, which exists independently of the basic axioms of the set theory. In contrast, Type Theory (and Homotopic Type Theory) provides a structure of understanding math with a single kind: the type.</p>
<p>Now don't ask me to explain anything more interesting than that yet.</p>
<h2 id="a-zulip-bot">A Zulip Bot</h2>
<p>I'm collaborating with a couple of other Recursers to make the <a href="https://github.com/bern/lunch-bot">lunch-bot</a>! Right now, lunch plans are made at the Recurse Center by signing up on a bunch of laminated pieces of paper on the 4th floor. We thought it was about time to modernize that system by making a Zulip chat bot that keeps track of lunch plans. No longer do you have to get up and actually <em>walk</em> around. Instead, you can stay in your chair and plan from the comfort of across the room, or even on another floor! Incredible!</p>

<p><em>CW: suicide</em></p>
<h2 id="last-time">Last Time</h2>
<p>I'm struggling not to make this blog post echo the tone of a college essay. It seems almost ironic that, after four years of attending university, the tropes I would return to are those I clumsily used to be accepted in the first place. It has become so familiar to present my first batch at the Recurse Center, and the events that preceded it, as an almost idealized catalyzing moment in my development. I'm going to try to avoid that trope here, but I can only do so well.</p>
<p>In 2014 I attended the Recurse Center months after my then-girlfriend of nine months took her own life. Not yet old enough, at the age of sixteen, to understand and cope with these feelings, I found peace in my work. At that time, I had been four years into a journey of self-teaching myself programming. Working on that project, my ravenous consumption of knowledge, gave me a kind of peace I could not find elsewhere. However unbeknownst to me, somewhere in my unconscious, perspective was growing; things that once seemed all consuming were not, and things that once seemed insurmountable seemed, for lack of better phrasing, seemed totally doable.</p>
<p>I was in desperate need of an environment to explore my independence. The Recurse Center provided that environment. I attended Fall 2, 2014, and found myself surrounded by wonderful people who, whether they knew it or not, helped catapault me to where I am today. I won't belabor the trope of personal growth (when I cannot show, only tell, it's probably best to skip it entirely), but I'm eternally thankful for everyone in Fall 1, Fall 2, and Winter 1, 2014 for helping shape me in that formative time.</p>
<h2 id="this-time">This Time</h2>
<p>This time around, I feel like I'm a completely different person. I would hope no less for myself, considering that the six years between 16 and 22 are supposed to be formative. Where I was, in no uncertain terms, a young boy before, I am now so much more prepared for what will come. I'm going to be living with my girlfriend of several years in the city. I'm going to be old enough to join in on, erm, after-school activities. I'm going to be able to interact with members of the community as, if not equal, then at least a hell of a lot more equal than last time.</p>
<p>Even more, I'm excited to use the knowledge that I gained last time around to help other members of the Recurse community. In 2014 I was a sponge, pulling in all of the knowledge I could muster. This time around, I hope to squeeze myself a little and let some of that knowledge back out. There will surely be programmers and computer scientists and developers far more accomplished than I am, but life has a curious way of giving every person their speciality. I'm just excited to share mine.</p>
<h2 id="this-blog">This Blog</h2>
<p>I kept a blog my last time at the Recurse Center, but I found that I only ever talked about my work. I want to make sure that I document more of my qualitative, personal experience this time around. I'm hoping that publicly documenting my intent will help me keep it. I mean to write, at minimum, at weekly post on each Friday. This one is coming out a little bit late because I've been in the middle of packing and preparing to move to NYC, but the rest will (should?) be on time.</p>
<p>P.S. Sorry if this is&hellip;rambling. I wrote it late at night. Maybe I'll do better next time :)</p>

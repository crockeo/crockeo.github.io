## Subheading

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a small village nestled between rolling hills and a sparkling river.
The villagers lived simple yet fulfilling lives, tending to their gardens and raising their families.
Every morning, the sun would rise, casting a golden glow over the fields, and the birds would sing sweet melodies that echoed through the air.

This is a quote:

> In the heart of the village stood an ancient oak tree, its branches stretching wide and tall.
> It was said to be the oldest tree in the land, and it held many secrets within its sturdy trunk.
> Children would gather beneath its shade, listening to the stories of the elders, who spoke of times long past and adventures yet to come.

And then something, *very* related to a quote, a piece of `code`:

```python
def hello_world() -> None:
    print("hello world")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

### Sub-sub-heading

The village *was* a **place** of ~harmony~, where everyone worked together for the common good.
Festivals were held throughout the year, celebrating the changing seasons and the bounties they brought.
The scent of fresh bread and blooming flowers filled the air, creating an atmosphere of joy and contentment.

## Wahoo

One day, a traveler arrived, bringing news from distant lands.
He spoke of grand cities, towering mountains, and vast oceans.
The villagers listened in awe, their imaginations ignited by tales of far-off places and extraordinary experiences.
It was a reminder that while their village was a haven of peace, there was a whole world waiting to be explored beyond the hills.

And so, life in the village continued, with each day bringing new opportunities and adventures.
The villagers cherished their home, knowing that they were part of something special, a story that would be told for generations to come.
